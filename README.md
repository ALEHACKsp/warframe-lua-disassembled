# Warframe lua disassembled
All lua files disassembled of the game Warframe, extracted straight from the game files and using the modified luadec by @Gudov.  
This repo will be updated every time Warframe updates!

Feel free to contact me or create an issue whenever I've missed an update.

# Update
Since a recent update they changed the way they compress the scripts in the cache files.  
No updates to this repo until I find a way to extract them again.  

Small update: cache extraction works again, but the decompiler needs some modifications as well. Still working on it!
